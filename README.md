# PyGp

Repository for storage and demonstration of a Python implementation of a genetic program.



## Contents

The real work is in GeneticProgram.py. This contains a single Python class *GeneticProgram*, which represents a standard linear genetic program.

Four notebooks accompany the main class. These notebooks implement tournament selection and breeder selection for both the Iris dataset [<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris>] and the TicTacToe endgame dataset [<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame>].



## Training

To train a program, just run any of the four notebooks that you're interested in (this requires an installation of Jupyter). The results will be displayed in real time.
